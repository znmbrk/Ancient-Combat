# Ancient-Combat
Single player street-fighter game. 

PREFACE

I had spent a long time looking for a project that would click with me and be on a level I could comprehend. I had different projects in mind but most of them weren't as exciting for me. For example, I looked into making a school facility hiring system and an employee timetable database as well as various other projects. But this project was more to my liking because I was intrigued by the idea of making something my fellow peers and I could actually use for ourselves. Furthermore, this project was just the right difficulty for me - I could understand all the code yet, it was still a challenge to reach the end. This is why I chose to make this Street Fighter type game called, “Ancient Combat”.

PURPOSE

Since my early gaming days on my Nintendo DS and PlayStation 2, I have always enjoyed tough, fighting games with intricate special moves and awesome attacking combinations. When it comes to creating a game, it’s almost like a piece of art - you put a bit of yourself into it. It’s this visualisation of my ideas and the fact that the thoughts in my head can become a real, working game is what enthralled me to just go for it and really make this my game. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to sharpen my coding skills and use them to make my plan come to life in a game that represents me and is a part of me which others can enjoy.
